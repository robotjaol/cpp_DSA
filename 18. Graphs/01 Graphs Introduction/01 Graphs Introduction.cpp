	V : vertices, E : edges

	1.Directed Graph :

		sum of indegrees = E
		sum of outdegrees = E
		maximum number of edges = V * ( V - 1 )

	2.Undirected Graph :

		sum of degrees = 2*E
		maximum number of edges = ( V * ( V - 1 ) ) / 2

	3.Some common graph terms :

		a. walk : A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges of a graph i.e.
		if we traverse a graph then we get a walk.
		Vertex can be repeated
		Edges canâ€™t be repeated

		b. path : A special walk in which Vertex and Edges can't be repeated.

		c. cyclic : A special walk which begins and ends at same vertex.

		d. acyclic : A graph which doesn't contain a cycle.
