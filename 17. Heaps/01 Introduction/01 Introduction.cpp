	Binary Heap used in implementations of:

		a.Heap Sort

		b.Priority Queue

	Two Types:

		a.Min Heap - Min element always at top / Every node is smaller than its descendants

		b.Max Heap - Max element always at top / Every node is greater than its descendants

	Properties:

		Binary Heap is a complete Binary Tree(stored as an array)

	Accessing Element:

		left[i]=2*i+1
		right[i]=2*i+2
		parent[i]=floor((i-1)/2)

	Advantages:

		a.Contigous Location

		b.Random Access

		c.Cache Friendly

		d.Complete Binary Tree - minimum height of tree is there(space efficient)
